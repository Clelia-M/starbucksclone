# ðŸ¥¤ Starbucks Christmas Clone

## Description

Clone of the Starbucks Christmas Landing page. This project was created following Traversy Media tutorial on YouTube.

It is built in HTML, CSS and a few lines of Javascript code. 

I love clone projects like this because they help me beter understand the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript in a real-world environment.
This one in particular is also completely responsive so I've learned how to use different media queries in CSS.
